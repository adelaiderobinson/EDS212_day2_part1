Scatterplot of body mass versus flipper length
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins ,  mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g , y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = species), size = 2) + facet_wrap(~island) +
  theme_minimal() +labs(x = "Body Mass (g)" ,
                        y= "Fliper Length (mm)" , title = "Penguins")
  #change the color of the points based on variable value, this goes within aes
#if you want to change something not based on a variable it doesn't go within aes, size =4, otherwise you will get an extra annoying legend
```
