## Derivates in R

# find the derivative of $$f(x) = 5x^2$$

dollar signs allow blocking

```{r}
#options for derivatives
#steps : 
# write evaluated expression
#define it using the derivative function
#assign a value to x and then evaluate
#you can also create a sequence of values for x and plug it in
ex_1 <- expression( 5 * x ^ 2)
my_derivative <- deriv(ex_1 , "x")
# I want to find the slope @ x=2.8
#assign the value to x 
x <-2.8
eval(my_derivative)

```

## Find the derivative a second way

Find the slope of $g(z) = 2 z^3 -10.5z^2 +4.1$
```{r}
gz <- expression(2 * z ^ 3 -10.5 * z ^2 +4.1)
#find the derivative
dg_dz <- D(gz , "z")
#gives a simpler output
# evaluate the slope over a sequence of values
z <- seq(from = -3, to = 4 , by = 0.5)
eval(dg_dz)
```
